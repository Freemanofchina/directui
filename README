This is my very unfinished, very much in progress fork of
http://www.viksoe.dk/code/windowless1.htm

DirectUI is a UI framework for Windows, in C++.

It's not an object-oriented wrapper around win32 functions like e.g. MFC.

It doesn't use standard Windows controls (well, except edit control)
but instead custom paints the controls on a single HWND window.

This is needed to achieve modern UI effects like transparency.

The original DirectUI was a very promising project but apparently was
abandoned in 2005.
